== Title

*Up Goer Five*

== Author

US Space Team

== Status

Draft

== Abstract

This SRFI provides the only flying space car that's taken anyone to
another world.

== Rationale

Why go to the moon? Why not Neptune? Why go using a rocket instead of
a giant spring?

== Specification

Detailed blueprint here.

== Implementation

Link to code. Explanation of implementations techniques,
compatibility, testing and limitations of scope and performance.

In the rare cases where the code is trivial, it can be inlined like
this:

[source,scheme]
----
(define (hello)
  (display "Hello world")
  (newline))
----

== Acknowledgements

I did it. I did it all, by myself.
